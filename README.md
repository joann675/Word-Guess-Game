# Word-Guess-Game

### Overview

In this game, you'll be guessing a word that the computer will randomly generate. 
All of the words will be models of cars so I hope you know your cars. If you win,
you'll get to listen to some cool music. If you lose, well at least I hope you 
were wearing your seatbelt.


### Before You Begin

I hope the instructions on the screen are clear.
I've tried to make the game as forgiving as possible so if you hit an invalid key
you will not be penalized.


### Contributions

If you have a song about cars, you can add it to the playlist and our jukebox collection can continue to grow.
